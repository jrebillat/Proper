# Proper
Property container and associated elements management library

## Concept
In Java, using reflection and annotations allow to add on-the-fly actions on the classes and objects from your code. This may be used to analyze code elements and store association between them.

in Proper, we use this concept to connect any object to special objects named *property containers*. This way, we are able to share information and manage actions in a very simple way, whitout much coding.
